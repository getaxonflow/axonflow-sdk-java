# OpenAPI schema snapshot for the wire-shape contract

The wire-shape contract (`scripts/wire_shape/validate.py`, run by `.github/workflows/wire-shape-contract.yml`) diffs the Java SDK's `@JsonProperty` wire models against the platform's OpenAPI specs. It reads the schema declarations under `components.schemas` and the names of each one's `properties`.

The four files here hold exactly that, and nothing else. `scripts/snapshot_openapi_schemas.py` derives them from the platform's `docs/api/*.yaml` at platform commit `36e0e96b7e5c16626d394272b727b533f2b94a04`, the v11.0.0 candidate. The script is vendored byte-identical from axonflow-sdk-python (`756f06136`), and the four files are byte-identical to that repository's `tests/fixtures/openapi/`, so the SDKs pin the same contract.

The script works on the YAML node graph, so every declaration survives in source order, including a schema declared twice in one file and a declaration with no properties. It drops descriptions, types, paths and the `info` block: the full specs carry the platform's own licence statement there, and this repository is MIT. It refuses a YAML merge key under `schemas` or `properties`, since loaders disagree on expanding one.

Each file's generated header names the platform commit it was derived from. `scripts/wire_shape/refresh.py` records that commit as the baseline's `openapi_specs_sha`, and the validator fails when the two disagree, so the baseline cannot name a revision the snapshot does not hold.

Regenerating `tests/fixtures/wire-shape-baseline.json` from these files gives a byte-identical baseline to regenerating it from the full specs, so nothing the contract checks is lost.

## Checking

    python3 scripts/snapshot_openapi_schemas.py --self-test
    python3 scripts/snapshot_openapi_schemas.py --check-snapshot tests/fixtures/openapi
    mvn -q compile dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/wire-shape-cp.txt

## Moving the pin

A change to the pinned SHA or to any file here needs the `spec-pin-bump` label on its pull request.

    python3 scripts/snapshot_openapi_schemas.py <platform-checkout>/docs/api tests/fixtures/openapi --source-commit <SHA>
